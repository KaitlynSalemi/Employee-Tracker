The user is first asked what they would like to do. They can add a row to a table, view any table, or update a role.

When the user chooses to add to a table they are given a list of all tables to choose from.

When Department is chosen for example, the user is then asked what department they would like to add.

Department added! 

The app then circles back to the top and asks the user what they would like to do next.

This time let's add a Role as an example.

When the user chooses to add a Role they then need to type the Role title,

the Salary for the Role,

and the id for the Department in which the Role should belong.

Role added!

In addidtion to adding a Role and a Department the user can also add an Employee. 

Next, the user can view any table in the database.

We can also update the Employee Roles
